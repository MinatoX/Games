    <p>This game was recreated from a 1 week project I did. This is mainly here for me to test html/js game scripting.</p>
    <p>The original version was scripted in LUA and made with the Love2D engine. Complete game can be downloaded here:</p>

    <p>The LUA version runs much better than this version, a I've yet to make proper optimizations to this version.
